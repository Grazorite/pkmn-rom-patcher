# Emerald Enhanced

## Overview

Emerald Enhanced is currently a BETA game. This game is an open world themepark variant of pokémon Emerald.
At any point, anything could break for any number of reasons. If you're not okay with this, then this may not be the game for you.
Also keep in mind that Emerald Enhanced is meant to be very challenging from the beginning.

The game is Feature Complete as of version 6.9 (August 22, 2020), however, the game continues to receive feature and content updates at the time of posting this.
I also do events from time to time for my players. (In addition to rotating out starters sometimes)
