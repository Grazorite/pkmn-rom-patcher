## Latest Changes (v6.1e)

- Adjusted Shiny DVs to allow a better chance of female shinies being spawned
- Game Corner now lists a 'Linking Cord' instead of the redundant 'Covenant Orb' as a prize

## Overview

This romhack is a complete re-imagining of the 1997 demo of Pokemon Gold and Silver.
Explore the Nihon region with an entirely new story and cast of beta Pokemon entirely done up in the style of Crystal's GBC graphics.
Based on lvl3's original Gold 97 hack, the game has been entirely re-balanced and remastered as well!

Go on a grand adventure catching Pokemon and taking down Team Rocket nationwide in this alternate sequel to the original Red and Blue!

## Features

Reforged comes in two versions, Gold and Silver, featuring differing sprites and encounter tables just like the real game.
All Pokemon are still catchable in each version!
